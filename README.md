# CoX Additions

Additional QOL features for CoX.

Some Features:
+ Detailed Prayer Enhance
+ Temporary olm highlight (highlights a 1x1 centered on olm's head and disappears when he pops up - removes the need to tag the head in npc indicators)
+ Hotkey swaps
+ True tile highlight list only for CoX NPCs
+ Makes leaving CC left click instead of right click in CoX (get out of corp simulator faster)
